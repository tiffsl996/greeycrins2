#Monday
Monday, I realized I had deleted four vital pages. I tried to get it back, but I realized it would be a long process. 

#Tuesday
As said by Confucious, it does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop. I went through the long and arduous process Chat had given me, failing at every step.

#Wednesday
I had given up on Chats methods, I decided to forgo them and create an entirely new repository. I created it and cloned the TEACHER repository. Wrong. From them intel I had recieved, I realized I was supposed to clone the STUDENT repository.

#Thursday
Success is in my reach, it was as certain that I would succeed as scientists were certain of the formation of the earth. I recieved the most helpful intel from Mr. Lopez and success was granted to my desperate self. 

#Friday
I did my tasks with the most ease knowing the hardest of days were now behind me.
